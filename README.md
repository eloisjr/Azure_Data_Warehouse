# Building an Azure Data Warehouse for Bike Share Data Analytics
 
 # **Project**

 "Data Warehouse for Bike Share Data Analytics" assignment from UDACITY course "Data Engineering with Microsoft Azure".

# **Project Overview**

Divvy is a bike-sharing program in Chicago, Illinois USA that allows riders to purchase a pass at a kiosk or use a mobile application to unlock a bike at stations around the city and use the bike for a specified amount of time. The bikes can be returned to the same station or to another station. The City of Chicago makes the anonymized bike trip data publicly available for projects like this where we can analyze the data.
There are 3 CSV files called payments, riders, stations, and trips. Since the data from Divvy are anonymous, we have created fake rider and account profiles along with fake payment data to go along with the data from Divvy. The data schema looks like this:

# **Objetive**

The goal of this project is to develop a data warehouse solution using Azure Synapse Analytics. You will:
	Design a star schema based on the business outcomes listed below
	Import the data into Synapse
	Transform the data into the star schema
	and finally, view the reports from Analytics.
